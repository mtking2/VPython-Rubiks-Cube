# PyCube

![PyCube Gif](resources/pycube.gif)

PyCube is an 3D interactive Rubik's Cube.

### Purpose
This software-based Rubik's Cube will serve as a basis for a later 
project in which I will attempt to create another program, implementing
a neural network algorithm, that will teach itself to solve a Rubik's Cube (PyCube).


### Dependencies

This program utilizes the following Python modules:

[VPython](http://vpython.org/)

[PyAudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/)

### Notable Mentions

Thanks to guy that heads up the [Possibly Wrong](https://possiblywrong.wordpress.com/) blog
I was able to use his "Yet Another Rubikâ€™s Cube" found [here](https://possiblywrong.wordpress.com/2011/01/15/yet-another-rubiks-cube/)
as a solid starting point. I have since heavily modified his original
version
